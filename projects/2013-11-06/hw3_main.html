<h2>Programming Project 3</h2>
<h3>Due Wednesday, November 6 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to get you to use arrays and loops in building a "real" program.</p>

<p>To submit your project, click on the <em>Project 3</em> link, and you should find a <em>Submit</em> link.  Attach your
Java file and your testing report.
Remember to attach the file that end in <tt>.java</tt>, not <tt>.class</tt> or <tt>.java~</tt>.</p>

<h3>General Guidelines (20% of your grade will be based on using good style)</h3>

<p>Guidelines continued from past projects:
<ul>
<li>You should place a JavaDoc comment at the top of the file that contains your name (with an appropriate tag)
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> JavaDoc comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be one sentence and describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Be certain to use the
appropriate JavaDoc tags for parameters, return values, and exceptions (if appropriate). </li>
<li>You should place a short JavaDoc comment directly above any field indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a comment next to any local variable (loop indeces do not need comments) indicating the purpose
of the variable. </li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.
Ideally, you should list the goal of the
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good invariant for the loop.</li>
<li>The class should be organized so the fields are at the top, then the constructors, then the non-static methods,
and finally the static methods.  The <tt>main</tt> method should be last.</li>
<li>There should be an empty line between the end of one method and the start of the JavaDoc comment for the next method.</li>
<li>All variables and methods should be named according to the standard Java protocol.</li>
<li>All code should be indented appropriately.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>New guidelines for this project.  You must keep your code as simple as possible.  That means:
<ul>
<li>You need to avoid unnecessary fields in your class.  Limit fields to data that <em>must</em> be stored between moves of the game
and can not be accessed through other means.</li>
<li>Your loops should be simple.  Avoid nested loops unless they are required.  <em>Hint</em>: If you are running through a two dimensional
area, a nested loop is needed, but if your algorithm is running in a straight line through the board (even if that line is not horizontal)
only a single, unnested loop is required.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Programming (60% of the project grade)</h3>

<p>For this project you will implement a modified game of <em>Jewel Quest</em>.</p>

<h4>Rules of the game:</h4>

<p>In our modified game, the game is played on a grid of "tiles". 
Each tile begins with a random jewel placed on the tile (we will represent the jewel type by the color of the tile).
The base game will be 8 rows and 10 columns with 4 different types of jewels.
For each legal move, you click a first tile and a second tile immediately next to it, either horizontally or vertically.
The jewels in the tiles are switched.
For every group of three or more tiles in a straight line, horizontally or vertically, that contain the same type of jewel
<em>and that contain the second clicked tile</em>, those tiles are marked with a <tt>*</tt>,
the jewels in those tiles are removed, 
the jewels in the tiles above the removed jewels slide down, and new random jewels are placed in the now empty tiles at the top of the grid.  
Note that the jewels slide, but the tile markings stay in place.  
The object of the game is to get every square of the grid "marked".  
If the second clicked tile is not part of any group of three or more tiles in a straight line containing the same jewel type, then this was 
not a legal move and the jewels in this tile and the initial clicked tile are switched back.
</p>

<p>For those who have played the "normal" Jewel Quest game, the main difference is that in the normal game, all straight lines of three or
more tiles with the same jewel are marked and removed, not just groups containing the second clicked tile, and any groupings of three or more
that appear as a result of sliding jewels are also automatically marked and removed.  In our version, no markings happen automatically, and
the tile groups to be marked and removed must include the second clicked tile.  Thus at most two lines of tiles will be marked and have jewels removed
with each move in the game.</p>

<h4>What you must do:</h4>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Read the instructions for the testing part of this project. You need to design your 
code so that it is easy to test.  If you put off writing the testing code to the end of the project, you may need to
rewrite your code to get testing to work.</p>

<p>You are to create a class called <tt>Jewels</tt>.  The <tt>Jewels</tt> class should have
two constructors:
<ol>
<li> <tt>public Jewels()</tt> <br>
    Creates a 8x10 grid with 4 different jewels.</li>
<li> <tt>public Jewels(int rows, int columns, int numJewels)</tt> <br>
    Creates a <tt>rows</tt>x<tt>columns</tt> grid.</li>
</ol>
You may assume that the minimum number of jewel types will be 2 and the maximum number will be 8.</p>

<p>The Jewels class should either extend <tt>JFrame</tt> or contain a <tt>JFrame</tt> that will be the window for the game.</p>

<h4>Create the board</h4>
<p>You are to create a board by making a two dimensional grid of <tt>JButton</tt>s on a <tt>JPanel</tt>.
You do this by setting the <em>layout manager</em> of the <tt>JPanel</tt> to be a
<tt>GridLayout</tt> of the appropriate size.  Here is code that creates a layout for a 4x4 grid:
<pre>
JPanel board = new JPanel(new GridLayout(4, 4));
</pre>
Then, the <tt>JPanel</tt> can be added as the center component of a <tt>JFrame</tt>,
<pre>
  <em>your JFrame</em>.getContentPane().add(board, "Center")
</pre> 
and you can
display the <tt>JFrame.</tt></p>
<p>
With a 4x4 grid, you can add up to 16 components to the <tt>JPanel</tt>.
Each component added to the <tt>JPanel</tt> will go into the grid in the following order:
<pre>
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16</pre>
Where the number <em>i</em> indicates the location of the <em>i</em>th added component.
</p>
<p>You should create a 2-dimensional array of <tt>JButton</tt>s and add them to the <tt>JPanel</tt>
in the appropriate order so that the location of a button in the array corresponds to its location
in the panel.  Try setting a default size for the <tt>JFrame</tt> so that it launches with
a reasonable board.  Do not use <tt>pack</tt> because it does not work if users want to
increase the <tt>JFrame</tt> size beyond the default.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of what your board should look like in the middle of a game:<br>
<img border="0" src="jewels.png" width="500" height="420"></p>

<h4>Implement the buttons</h4>
<p>You should create an <tt>ActionListener</tt> for the buttons.  Recall that an
<tt>ActionListener</tt> has a method <tt>actionPerformed</tt> that is called every time
the button is pressed.  The <tt>actionPerformed</tt> method has a single parameter,
<tt>ActionEvent e</tt>, and you can get the button that was pressed by using the code
<pre>JButton b = (JButton)e.getSource();</pre>
<tt>b</tt> is the button that was pressed, and you can locate this button in your
array of buttons to determine <tt>b</tt>'s row and column.</p>

<p>When a button is pressed, the code should save the button (or its location) and wait for a second 
button press.  On the second press, your code should get the second button, check to see if the two
clicked buttons are adjacent, and swap the colors of those buttons.  It is not hard to determine 
if two buttons are adjacent because you get the button that was clicked from the <tt>ActionEvent</tt> 
parameter, and you have all the possible buttons stored in their appropriate location in a two-dimensional
array.  If the user did not click adjacent buttons, you start again waiting for the first button click.</p>

<p>You now need to see if there are at least three jewels in a straight
line, horizontally or vertically, containing the second clicked tile.
If there are, these tiles need to be marked and the jewels removed.  <em> Do not place all the code for this
into the <tt>actionPerformed</tt> method.  You need to have JUnit tests so you should create separate methods 
to handle these actions.</em></p>

<h4>What to do on a win</h4>

<p>Once all the tiles have been marked, you are to print a message indicating that the game is over
and list the total number of legal moves it took to complete the game.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Mac machines do not, by default, permit you to change the color of a button.  Probably because Apple
thinks it knows better than you what a user interface should look like.  To be able to set a button's background color, you need to
add this code to your program (either in the constructor or the main method):
<pre>
    try {
      UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName());
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
    }
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Add a <tt>main</tt> method</h4>
<p>The <tt>Jewels</tt> class should have a <tt>main</tt> method that launches the Jewels
game.  With a <tt>main</tt> method, you should be able to play your game by typing:
<pre>java Jewels</pre>
in the Interactions pane.  You should also allow the user to enter three arguments, the
board size and the number of jewel types.  For example: <br>
<tt>java Jewels</tt> should start a game with a 10x10 grid and 4 different jewel types (colors), and<br>
<tt>java Jewels 8 12 5</tt> should start a game with 8 rows, 12 columns, and 5 different jewels.
If the user enters something other than realistic numbers, your code should
do something appropriate, but not crash.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Do not try to code everything at once!  First just get the game board displaying.
Then add the ability to click on a button and have text appear on the button clicked.  Then make it so that the correct
button gets the text.  Then write code to search for a win.
Finally, get the
<tt>main</tt> method working.</p>

<h3>JUnit Testing</h3>

<p>You are to write JUnit tests for this program.  You obviously will not be able to test the <tt>main</tt> method, the constructors, or the action listener with JUnit
because these expect user input or display a window to the screen.  Instead, break the logic of your program into small, easy to test methods, and write
JUnit tests for those methods.
Remember the tips for testing: <em>test 0, test 1, test many</em> and 
<em>test first, test middle, test last</em>.  For example,
first, middle, last can refer to the locations on the game board (ex: on the edge or in the middle).
Your testing report should describe what you consider to be "units" of the game and what 
"test 0, test 1, test many" and "test first, test middle, test last" means for each unit you test.</p>

<h3>Extra Credit:</h3>

<p>If you decide to do an extra credit, <em>you must state in the Blackboard comments what you did</em>.  Don't make us hunt
through your code to figure out what extra you did.</p>

<h4>Extra Credit #1</h4>

<p>Create fancier Jewels game.  Instead of using the button color to indicate the jewel type and a <tt>'*'</tt> to indicate if the 
tile is marked, set all buttons to initially have the same background color.  Use different shaped and colored <em>icons</em> for the jewels,
change the background to yellow to indicate a tile being marked, and use a different color to indicate when a button is pressed.</p>

<h4>Extra Credit #2</h4>

<p>Make further improvements to the aesthetics of the game.  Here are three possible ideas: add fancy borders and extra areas to the game board
that display useful information, animate the jewel movements, add a timer and instead of counting the number of moves the game goes until the
timer runs out, or add obstacles to the board: tiles that do not contain jewels, do not slide, and will not be marked.  For many of these 
ideas, you will need to hunt through the Java API.</p>
