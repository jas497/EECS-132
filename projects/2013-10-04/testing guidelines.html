<h2>Project 1, Testing Report Guidelines</h2>

<h3>What your report should contain</h3>

<p>First, it should contain a description of how to test each method on the homework description, regardless of
whether you implemented the method.  Note that you are allowed to test more than one method with a single test,
but you should not test too many methods with one test.  Otherwise, if the test result is incorrect, you will
have a hard time telling what was the cause of the error.</p>

<p>For each method you implemented, you are to list the results of performing the test on your code. 
<em>The results must be accurate. You will lose a lot of points if you report a different result than your code
gives.</em>  If the result returns an incorrect answer, and you do not have time to correct your code, you are
to make a note of that in your report.</p>

<h3>How to do your report</h3>

<p>Start your report at the same time that you start coding.  As you test each method, write down the results.  If any tests
are incorrect, try fixing the method and retesting.  Once you get it working, place the test of the correct method
in your report.  If you make significant changes to your class, you can go back and retest the old tests to make 
sure the results are still correct.</p>

<h3>Sample tests for the Stock class</h3>

<p><strong>1. Getter/Setter Methods</strong> The following tests the getter/setter methods of the Stock class.  The value returned by the getter method should match the value 
set by the setter method.
<pre>
> Stock stock = new Stock("T", 35.34)
> stock.setCompanyName("Verizon");
> stock.getCompanyName()
"Verizon"
> stock.setTickerSymbol("VZ");
> stock.getTickerSymbol()
"VZ"
> stock.setCurrentPrice(50.25);
> stock.getCurrentPrice()
50.25
</pre></p>

<p><strong>2. Constructors</strong> This test verifies that the constructor sets the appropriate values.
<pre>
> Stock stock = new Stock("T", 35.34)
> stock.getTickerSymbol()
"T"
> stock.getCurrentPrice()
35.34
> stock.getNumberShares()
0
> stock.getCapitalGains()
0.0
</pre></p>

<p><strong>3. The <tt>buy</tt> method.</strong>  If we purchase 10 shares at 50 dollars per share and a 7 dollar commission, the returned value should be 507.0, the cost basis
should increase by 507.0, and the number of shares should increase by 10.
<pre>
> Stock stock = new Stock("T", 50)
> stock.buy(10, 7.0)
507.0
> stock.getNumberShares()
10
> stock.getCostBasis()
507.0
> stock.buy(10, 7.0)
507.0
> stock.getNumberShares()
20
> stock.getCostBasis()
1014.0
</pre></p>

<p><strong>4. The <tt>sell</tt> method.</strong> If we sell more than 20 shares, the method should return 0 and nothing happens.
If we sell 10 shares price 100 with a commission of 7, the cost basis should go down to 507, the capital gains
should increase by 1000-7 - 507 = 993-507 = 486, and the return value should be 993.  
If we then sell the remaining shares 10 at price 25 with a commission of 7,
the costBasis should drop to 0, the capital gains should increase by 250-7 - 507 = 243-507 = -264 resulting in a new capital gains of 222, and 243 should be returned.
<pre>
> stock.getNumberShares()
20
> stock.getCostBasis()
1014.0
> stock.setCurrentPrice(100)
> stock.sell(30, 7)
0.0
> stock.getNumberShares()
20
> stock.getCostBasis()
1014.0
> stock.sell(10, 7)
993.0
> stock.getCostBasis()
507.0
> stock.getCapitalGains()
486.0
> stock.setCurrentPrice(25)
> stock.sell(10, 7)
243.0
> stock.getCostBasis()
0.0
> stock.getCapitalGains()
222.0
</pre>
