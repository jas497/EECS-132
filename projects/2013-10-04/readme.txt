This project is to represent a stock account.  It has five files - four .java code
files, and a fifth .txt for testing data.  This readme does not count.  Basic des-
cription of project is to learn java.  Full, professor-provided description is in
the HTML file, which was copied directly from Opera's cache, and renamed.

old_stock is partially modified from original, after re-reading commenting rules.
It retains the Javadoc comments, although the columns of fields have been broken
up as per instructions.
