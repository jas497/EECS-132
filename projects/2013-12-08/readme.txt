Network fodder
Some example network files have been added.  Each has about the same number of entities and relation pairs, but each has been organized in a different manner.  Once you get the project written, you can try playing with the different networks.  For example, does the network type affect how quickly a disease can spread?  For each network, how many entities need to be inoculated to prevent a large outbreak?

US_Cities_Hypercube.txt : the entities are US cities, and the network as been organized as a 7-dimensional cube.

World_Cities_Random.txt: the entities are international cities, and the network of relations is random (or pseudorandom since it was computer generated)

Hospitals_4_tree.txt:  the entities are US hospitals, and the network is organized as a "4-tree".  A tree-like network where specific sets of 4 entities will disconnect the network.

BoyNames_SmallWorlds_Low.txt: the entities are popular American boy names, and the network uses Kleinberg's "small worlds" model with a low clustering coefficient.

GirlNames_SmallWorlds_High.txt: the entities are popular American girl names, and the network uses Kleinberg's "small worlds" model with a high clustering coefficient.
