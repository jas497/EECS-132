<h2>Programming Project 4</h2>
<h3>Due Sunday, December 8 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p><strong>As Monday, December 9 is the Reading Day before final exams, <em>no late assignments will be accepted</em>.</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to practice using linked lists, generic types, and iterators.</p>

<p>To submit your project, click on the <em>Project 5</em> link, and you should find a <em>Submit</em> link.  Attach your
Java files and your testing report.
Remember to attach the file that end in <tt>.java</tt>, not <tt>.class</tt> or <tt>.java~</tt>.</p>

<h3>General Guidelines (20% of your grade will be based on using good style)</h3>

<p><strong>Important Rule</strong>: You are to use one of the linked list classes we developed in the course.  It does not matter 
which one you use.  You may add additional methods as needed to the linked list class, but you should use the linked list efficiently.
<em>You may not use the <tt>LinkedList</tt> or any other <tt>Collection</tt>s class from the Java API.</em></p>

<p>You may <em>not</em> add additional methods to the classes listed below.</p>

<p>Guidelines continued from past projects:
<ul>
<li>You should place a JavaDoc comment at the top of the file that contains your name (with an appropriate tag)
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> JavaDoc comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be one sentence and describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Be certain to use the
appropriate JavaDoc tags for parameters, return values, and exceptions (if appropriate). </li>
<li>You should place a short JavaDoc comment directly above any field indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a comment next to any local variable (loop indeces do not need comments) indicating the purpose
of the variable. </li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.
Ideally, you should list the goal of the
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good invariant for the loop.</li>
<li>The class should be organized so the fields are at the top, then the constructors, then the non-static methods,
and finally the static methods.  The <tt>main</tt> method should be last.</li>
<li>There should be an empty line between the end of one method and the start of the JavaDoc comment for the next method.</li>
<li>All variables and methods should be named according to the standard Java protocol.</li>
<li>All code should be indented appropriately.</li>
<li>You need to avoid unnecessary fields in your class. </li>
<li>Your loops should be simple.  Avoid nested loops unless they are required.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Programming (60% of the project grade)</h3>

<p>A current area of research involves modelling propagation on a network.  For example, we can use the model to study how disease spreads in
a society or how fast information spreads across a social network.</p>

<p>Your project should contain the following classes:
<ol><li><p>The <em>Entity</em> class.  The entity represents a person, organization, or other entity in the social network.
The Entity class contains an enum type that indicates the <em>health status</em> of the entity.
<pre>
public Enum Health {Uninfected, Infected, Inoculated, BeingInfected, BeingInoculated}
</pre>
The Entity class should implement the <tt>Comparable</tt> interface, and entities can be ordered by their <em>name</em>.
The Entity class contains the following methods:
<ol><li><p><tt>getName</tt> and <tt>setName</tt>: the name is a <tt>String</tt>.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>getHealthStatus</tt> and <tt>setHealthStatus</tt>: the health status is the enum <tt>Health</tt> type.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>getRelations</tt>: relations is a linked list that stores <tt>Entity</tt> objects.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>equals</tt>: the equals method overrides the one in <tt>Object</tt>.  Two <tt>Entity</tt> objects are equal if they have the same name.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>toString</tt>: the string representation should be the name and health status of the entity.</p></li>
</ol>
The entity class constructor should take the entity's name as input and set the <em>name</em>, initialize the <em>relations</em> to an empty linked list,
and initialize the <em>health status</em> to <tt>Uninfected</tt>.</p></li>

<li><p>The <em>Network</em> class.  The network represents the social network of entities.
The Network class should implement the <tt>Iterable</tt> interface and should contain a linked list that stores all the entities of the network.
The <tt>Iterator</tt> for the network should iterate over all the entities in the network.
The Network class contains the following methods:
<ol><li><p><tt>addRelation</tt> takes two <tt>Entity</tt> objects.  If either entity is not in the network, it is added to the network.  (There should not be duplicate
entities in the network.)  Then, for each entity, add the other entity to its <em>relations</em> list.</p></li>
   <li><p><tt>removeRelation</tt> takes two <tt>Entity</tt> objects.  Each entity is removed from the other's <em>relations</em> list.  The entities are <em>not</em>
removed from the network.</p></li>
   <li><p><tt>addRelations</tt> takes a <tt>File</tt> parameter.  The file contains a list of relations.  Each relation will be a pair of names.  The names of a relation
pair are separated by a comma, and each relation pair is on its own line.  For example:
<pre>
University Hospitals, Cleveland Clinc
University Hosptials, Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center
Cleveland Clinic, Mercy Regional Medical Center
</pre>
The method may throw an exception if there is a problem with the file.  Each pair of names should be added to the network as a relation of <tt>Entity</tt> objects
with those names.</p>
   <li><p><tt>addRelations</tt> takes a <em>variable length parameter</em> of <tt>String</tt>s.  There should be an even number of <tt>String</tt>s.  An exception may
be thrown if there is not an even number.  The method should create <tt>Entity</tt> instances for each <tt>String</tt> and for each pair of names (first two names,
second two names, etc.) the pair of entities should be added to the network as a relation.</p></li>
</ol>
The Network class should have a constructor that takes no input and initializes an empty network.</p></li>

<li><p>The <em>PropagationStudy</em> class.  The <em>PropagationStudy</em> class will run a simulation on the network of entities.  The class should have the following methods:
<ol><li><p><tt>getNetwork</tt> and <tt>setNetwork</tt>: the network is a <tt>Network</tt> instance associated with this study.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>getInfectionRate</tt> and <tt>setInfectionRate</tt>: the infection rate is a double between 0 and 1 (inclusive).</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>getHealRate</tt> and <tt>setHealRate</tt>: the heal rate is a double between 0 and 1 (inclusive).</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>getWearRate</tt> and <tt>setWearRate</tt>: the wear rate is a double between 0 and 1 (inclusive).</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>infect</tt> takes an <tt>Entity</tt> as a parameter.  The matching entity in the network should have its <em>health status</em> set to <tt>Infected</tt>.  Throw a <tt>NoSuchElement</tt> exception if the entity is not in the network.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>infect</tt> takes a <tt>double</tt> value between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Each entity in the network will have its <em>health status</em> set to <tt>Infected</tt>
        with a probability equal to the parameter.  Use <tt>Math.random()</tt> or an equivalent pseudorandom number generator and if the value is less than the parameter value, the entity is infected.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>inoculate</tt> takes an <tt>Entity</tt> as a parameter.  The matching entity in the network should have its <em>health status</em> set to <tt>Inoculated</tt>.  Throw a <tt>NoSuchElement</tt> exception if the entity is not in the network.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>inoculate</tt> takes a <tt>double</tt> value between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Each entity in the network will have its <em>health status</em> set to <tt>Inoculated</tt>
        with a probability equal to the parameter.  Use <tt>Math.random()</tt> or an equivalent pseudorandom number generator and if the value is less than the parameter value, the entity is inoculated.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>getNumUninfected</tt>, <tt>getNumInoculated</tt>, <tt>getNumInfected</tt>: each method will return the number of entities in the network with the 
        desired <em>health status</em>.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>resetNetwork</tt>: takes no input and changes the <em>health status</em> of every entity in the network to <tt>Uninfected</tt></li></p>
    <li><p><tt>printNetwork</tt>: prints using <tt>System.out.println</tt> each entities name and health status in the network. The output should be ordered by the
              names of the entities.</li></p>
    <li><p><tt>runPropagation</tt>: takes no input and does the following in order.  
        <ul><li>First, for every entity that is <tt>Infected</tt>, run through all of its <em>relations</em>, and for every relation that is <tt>Uninfected</tt> call
                <tt>Math.random()</tt> or similar pseudorandom number generator and if the value is less than the <em>infection rate</em>, set the relation's health status
                to <tt>BeingInfected</tt>.</li>
            <li>Second, for every entity that is <tt>Infected</tt> call your pseudorandom number generator and if the value is less than the <em>heal rate</em>,
                set the entity's health status to <tt>BeingInoculated</tt>.</li>
            <li>Third, for every entity that is <tt>Inoculated</tt> call your pseudorandom number generator and if the value is less than the <em>wear rate</em>,
                set the entity's health status to <tt>Uninfected</tt>.</li>
            <li>Fourth, for every entity that is <tt>BeingInfected</tt> set it's health status to <tt>Infected</tt> and for every entity that is <tt>BeingInoculated</tt> set
                its health status to <tt>Inoculated</tt>.</li></ul>
     <li><p><tt>runPropagation</tt>: takes an <tt>int</tt> value and calls the above <tt>runPropagation</tt> method a number of times equal to the parameter.  If the parameter
         is not a positive integer, then the method does nothing.</p></li>
  </ol>
  The PropagationStudy class should have a constructor that takes a <em>network</em>, <em>infection rate</em>, <em>heal rate</em>, and <em>wear rate</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>The <tt>main</tt> method.</strong> The PropagationStudy class should have a <tt>main</tt> method that takes six or seven command line arguments: a file name, an infection rate, a heal rate, a wear rate,
      a number of rounds, and one or two more file names.  The method should create a <tt>Network</tt> using the first file name, and create a <tt>PropogationStudy</tt> using the network and the different rates.
      The sixth command line argument is the name of a file containing a list of <em>initially infected</em> entity names, one name per line.  The optional seventh command line argument will be the name of a file
      containing a list of <em>initially inoculated</em> entity names.  The <tt>main</tt> method should infect and inoculate those listed entities.
      The method should then run the propogation for the given number of rounds, and then print a message listing the number of entities healthy, infected, and inoculated at the
      end of the desired rounds.  The <tt>main</tt> method should not throw any exceptions.</p></li></ol>

<p>By changing the different rates, you can test different types of propogations.  For example, setting an infection rate, heal rate, and wear rate between 0 and 1, we can
study how diseases move. (Some diseases such as the flu appear to have a 0 wear rate, but for others such as whooping cough, the wear rate is positive.)  
We can also see what happens if, part way through a disease study, we inoculate a certain percentage of the entities.</p>
<p>By setting the heal rate to 0, we can test how fast information spreads in a network.  By removing certain relation pairs, we can see how effectively we can slow
down the information spread through disrupting some of the network links.</p>

<p>Some sample networks will be generated for you and posted on Blackboard so that you can have some fun running different simulations.</p>
<h3>JUnit Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>You are to write JUnit tests for your classes as well as a testing report.  The testing report should describe the <em>kinds</em> of tests that are required
for this project.  The JUnit testing classes should have comments and testing method names matching the specific tests to the descriptions in your report.</p>
