<h2>Programming Project 5 Grading Rubric</h2>

<h3>1. JUnit Testing: 20 points</h3>
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>20</td>  <td> Correct JUnit tests demonstrate that the code (including the linked list) correctly works <em>ignoring random numbers or user/file inputs</em>.  
			Tests of conditionals cover the different execution paths.
			Tests of loops correctly test 0, 1, many and first, middle, last.
			Report clearly describes the kind of tests needed, and matches JUnit tests written.
			Descriptions of required tests for incomplete methods and descriptions of code errors are included.
		</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td>  <td> Similar to 20 except that a few obvious cases were not tested.
                        </td></tr>
  <tr><td>15</td>  <td> Correct JUnit tests for all methods, possibly missing just a few obvious cases, but no testing report provided OR  
                        a good testing report provided as well as mostly complete tests for at least three classes including the EmployeeDatabase class.
                        </td></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td>  <td> At least once class has all necessary JUnit tests completed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10</td>  <td> At least a few methods that have conditional statements or loops have correct JUnit tests written. </td><tr>
  <tr><td>0</td>   <td> No reasonable JUnit testing done.</td></tr>

<h3>2. Readability: 20 points</h3>
  <h4> Basic program structure </h4>
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>10</td> <td>Correct comments at top of class, above each method, above each field,
                      above each loop, and next to or above each variable.  (Comments are -not- required next to any index variables used in the loops.)
                      The comments are at most one to three sentences and are a good
                      description.  The comments above each loop indicate how the loop works and any prerequisites for the
                      loop.  (The loop subgoal/invariant would be nice but is -not- required.)
                     All code follows the proper indentation and
                     naming style.  An empty line is placed between the end of one method and the comment of the next.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>9</td> <td>Mostly indented well (up to two places not indented correctly) AND most names correctly follow the
                      naming convention (up to two poorly named variables or methods) AND at most one missing comment on a loop or other complicated code.
                      Each comment is a good description.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>8</td> <td>Good indentation for at least three of the methods AND at least half of the methods and loops have comments that are at most
                      1-3 sentences and not direct copies of the homework description.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td> <td>At least one method is well commented or there is a comment above every method and the class AND at least one method is nicely indented.</td>
  <tr><td>3</td>  <td>At least one method is well commented OR at least one method is nicely indented.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0</td>  <td>No methods have either good comments or good indentation.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

  <h4>JavaDoc Comments</h4>
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>10</td><td>All comments above the class, fields, and methods follow the JavaDoc comment style.  Correct tags are added
                     for the author, all method parameters and return types.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>9</td><td>All comments above the class, fields, and methods follow the JavaDoc comment style, and most of the comments
                    contain and have correct all required tags. (At most 5 missing or misspelled tags.)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>7</td><td>Most comments above the class, fields, and methods follow the JavaDoc comment style, but a significant number of places are
                     missing tags or the tags are misspelled so the comments are not formatted properly on the webpage.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>Most comments in JavaDoc style of /** but missing most tags OR has most tags but the comments do not start
                    with /** and so do not appear on the webpage.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0</td><td>No JavaDoc comments provided.</td></tr>

                      the main method does not throw an exception, there are no major errors.</td>
  <tr><td>18</td><td>The class uses the Network iterator correctly, the Entity Comparable interface is used correctly to order the entities when printing, the main methods is mostly correct,
there are no major errors but either the main method throws an exception
OR the enum type is not used correctly OR the class is not in the proper position in the hierarchy OR some of the methods were not completed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>16</td><td>There are multiple errors but the class correctly uses the Entity Comparable interface in sorting the entities for printing AND a reasonable main method is provided AND
at least half of the methods demonstrate the proper use of an iterator (if Network correctly implements Iterable, the Network iterator must be used).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>14</td><td>At least half of the methods of the class demonstrate the proper use of an iterator (if Network correctly implements Iterable, the Network iterator must be used).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10</td><td>The Network class implements Iterable, but no method of the PropagationStudy class correctly demonstrates the proper use of the Network iterator. At least one method
that requires the use of an iterator properly uses the iterator.</td></tr> 
  <tr><td>0</td><td>No method of the PropagationStudy class correctly demonstrates the proper use of iterators.</td></tr>
