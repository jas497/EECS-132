<h2>Programming Project 3</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, October 18 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to give you practice writing loops.  </p>

<h3>General Guidelines (20% of your grade will be based on using good style)</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>All methods listed below must be <tt>public</tt> and <tt>static</tt>.</li>
<li>You may write additional <em>private</em> helper methods, but <em>see the point below about simple code</em>, and do not write helper methods that make your code do extra traversals of the input.</li>
<li>You should place a comment at the top of the file that contains your name
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be one sentence and describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Do not simply copy the descriptions
below for your comments.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment directly above each field (if you have any)
indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.  Ideally, you should list the goal of the 
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good iteration subgoal for the loop.</li>
<li>Any other complicated code such as code the has lots of if statements or variables should contain <em>short</em> comments to help the reader.  The comments can either be above the code fragment or to the right, aligned in a column.</li>
<li>If your code is using a loop to modify or create a string, you need to use the <tt>StringBuilder</tt> class from the API.</li>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> While it is tempting to hunt through the API to find methods of <tt>String</tt> and <tt>StringBuilder</tt> to help you, most of the methods will be too inefficient for good code.  You should limit your code to use the
<tt>charAt</tt> and <tt>length</tt> methods of <tt>String</tt> and the
<tt>append</tt>, <tt>charAt</tt>, <tt>setCharAt</tt>, <tt>length</tt>, and <tt>toString</tt> methods of <tt>StringBuilder</tt>.  You may use methods from the <tt>Character</tt>
class though they are not required.</li>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> You should not use the commands <tt>break</tt> nor <tt>continue</tt> in your loops.</li>
<li>Remember to use good style: everything should be indented nicely, variables should have good names, there should be a blank line between each method.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>To submit your project, click on the <em>HW 2</em> link, and you should find a <em>Submit</em> link.  Attach your
Java file and your testing report.
Remember to attach the files that end in <tt>.java</tt>, not <tt>.class</tt> or <tt>.java~</tt>.</p>

<h3>Part I: Programming (60% of your grade will be correctness of the following)</h3>

<p>Try to keep your code as simple as possible by avoiding traversing the string multiple times.  As a hint, all of the required methods can be done with a single
traversal of the string(s). <strong>Clarification</strong>: You are not <em>required</em> to code each method so that it only traverses each string once.  For example, doing two traversals
where each traversal does a single step per character is just as efficient as a single traversal that does two steps per character.  What you need to do is keep your algorithm simple.  
The fact that each required method can be done with a single traversal is a hint that, if your first attempt requires lots of traversals, there is a simpler way.</p>

<p>Create a class called <tt>HW2</tt> that contains the following methods:
<ol>
<li><p><tt>matchingParentheses</tt> takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a <tt>boolean</tt>:<br>
The method should return true if all the parentheses (if any) in the input are properly matched.  Any closing parenthesis <tt>')'</tt> should be preceded by
a matching open parenthesis <tt>'('</tt> and there should be exactly one open parenthesis for each closed parenthesis.
 <br>
<tt>matchingParentheses("This is a (test (of the) (matching)) parentheses")</tt> should return <tt>true</tt><br>
<tt>matchingParentheses("The (second closing) parenthesis) does not match")</tt> should return <tt>false</tt>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>everyNthExcept(String string, int start, int skip, int except)</tt> returns a <tt>String</tt><br>
Returns every <tt>skip</tt>th character of <tt>string</tt>, starting with the <tt>start</tt>-th character, except
do not include the character if it is one of the <tt>except</tt>-th characters from <tt>start</tt>.  For example:
<tt>everyNthExcept(s, 2, 2, 4)</tt> should include every 2nd character of <tt>s</tt>, starting with the second character
of <tt>s</tt>, but it does not include every 4th character after the second character of <tt>s</tt>.
You can assume <tt>start</tt>, <tt>skip</tt>, and <tt>except</tt> are all positive.<br>
<tt>everyNthExcept("abcdefghijklmnop", 2, 2, 4)</tt> should return <tt>"bdhlp"</tt><br>
<tt>everyNthExcept("abcdefghijklmnop", 3, 2, 4)</tt> should return <tt>"ceim"</tt>
</p></li>


<li><p><tt>reverseDigits</tt> should take a <tt>String</tt> as input and output a <tt>String</tt>.<br>
The output <tt>String</tt> should be identical to the input <tt>String</tt> except all digits (0 through 9) of
the input <tt>String</tt> are in reverse order (but same locations) in the output <tt>String</tt>.<br>
<tt>reverseDigits("0 the d1gits of the2 string3 4 are8 reversed 9!")</tt> should return <tt>"9 the d8gits of the4 string3 2 are1 reversed 0!"</tt>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>editOut</tt> should take a <tt>String</tt> as input and output a <tt>String</tt>.<br>
You may assume the input <tt>String</tt> has properly matched parentheses. <em>The behavior for improperly matched parentheses is up to you, but the method should not crash.</em>
The output <tt>String</tt> should be identical to the input <tt>String</tt> except that any text inside a pair of matched parentheses is removed, including the parentheses.
In addition, if there is a pair of matched parentheses inside the removed text, that text should be retained (though the parentheses should be removed).  If there are any matched parentheses
inside the retained text, that text should be removed, and so on.<br>
<tt>editOut("this is an (unusual (example)) of (editing out and (retaining)) text")</tt> should return <tt>"this is an example of retaining text"</tt></br>
<tt>editOut("this is (another) (example) showing (((((removal))))) -( and )- ((((retention))))")</tt> should return <tt>"this is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;showing&nbsp;&nbsp-- retention"</tt>
</p>
</li>

<li><p><tt>replaceText</tt> takes two <tt>String</tt>s as input and returns a <tt>String</tt>.<br>
Each input string will have text with zero or more substrings marked by matching parentheses.
The returned string should contain the contents of the first string, except that 
each substring that is inside parentheses in the first input string is replaced by the 
matching substring that is inside parentheses in the second input string.  (So the first substring of string 1
is replaced by the first substring of string 2, the second by the second, and so on.)  If the first input string has more
substrings in matching parentheses than the second string does, the substrings are simply removed.
If the second string has more substrings in matching parentheses, these are ignored.
Any nested and matched parentheses (matched parentheses inside the outer set of matched parentheses) should be treated as regular characters.<br>
<tt>replaceText("a (simple) programming (example)", "(cool) (problem)")</tt> should return <tt>"a cool programming problem"</tt><br>
<tt>replaceText("a ((nested) example) with (three) replacements (to (handle))", "the replacements are (answer) and (really (two) not three)")</tt> should return <tt>"an answer with really (two) not three replacements "</tt>
<br>
As before, the behavior for unmatched parentheses is up to you, but your method should not crash.
</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Extra Credit:</strong> <tt>reverseAll</tt> should take a <tt>String</tt> and return a <tt>String</tt><br>
All substrings inside matching parentheses should be reversed.  If the reversed portion contains matching parentheses, these should be "re-reversed" and so on.
The parentheses should still be correctly matched and nested about the different affected substrings.<br>
<tt>reverseAll("a b (c d e (f g) (h (i j k l (m n o) (p q)) r s t)) (u v w) x y z")</tt> should return <tt>"a b ((h ((p q) (m n o) l k j i) r s t) (f g) e d c) (w v u) x y z"</tt>
</p></li>

</ol></p>

<h3>Part 2: Project Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>You need to write tests for each of the methods above.  Your tests should be thorough.
Your testing report should describe why your test cases sufficiently tested your code as well as the specific tests you ran and their results.
If you are unable to complete a method above, you should still
describe tests that would test the method had it been completed.</p>

<p>Hints for testing loops.  Your tests need to, at the minimum cover the following cases:
<ol>
<li><strong>Test 0, test 1, test many:</strong>  This means you have to test cases where the parameters, if they are integers,
are 0, 1 or some value other than 1.  If the parameters are strings, you have to test strings of length 0, 1, and more than 1.
If the strings must contain certain data, you need to test cases where they contain 0, 1, and more than 1 of the desired data.</li>
<li><strong>Test first, last, and middle:</strong>  In cases where you have to search in or modify a string, you need to test
cases where the item to be found or modified is the first character of the string, the last character of the string, or somewhere
in the middle of the string.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>In summary, your tests should cover each of the above cases for each of the methods you complete in the homework.
Your testing report should state what <em>test 0, test 1, test many</em> and <em>test first, last, and middle</em> mean for each of the homework
methods and how your tests covered these cases.</p>

<p><strong>JUnit</strong>: you will be learning about JUnit soon in a lab.  JUnit will be required for future homeworks, and you are welcome
to use it with this homework.  If you choose to write JUnit tests for your code,
your report should not list the specific tests and their results because the graders can run your JUnit tests.
Instead, your report should only detail what <em>test 0, test 1, test many</em> and <em>test first, last, and middle</em> means for each
method and why your JUnit tests cover those cases.
