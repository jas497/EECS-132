<h2>Programming Project 2 Grading Rubric</h2>

<h3>1. Testing: 20 points</h3>
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>20</td>  <td> A description of how to thoroughly test all the methods of the assignment, and the tests clearly
                        check the required 0, 1, many, and first, middle last, cases.
                        Completed tests for each method written in the student's submission.  
	                Each test gives the true output of the student's submission.
                        A note on any test that gives an incorrect result.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td>  <td> A testing description for all of the methods and completed tests for all of the methods.  
                        The testing covered at least four of the required cases for each of the methods.
                        </td></tr>
  <tr><td>15</td>  <td> For at least three of the methods, the tests and/or descriptions of what to test covered at least half of the required cases.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td>  <td> For at least two of the methods, multiple tests and/or descriptions of what to test cover at least one of the required cases.
                       </td></tr>
  <tr><td>10</td>  <td> Some testing done. </td><tr>
  <tr><td>0</td>   <td> No testing done.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>-10</td> <td> Includes output for methods that were not in the student's submission OR gives 
                        any results misrepresenting how the student's code works.</td></tr>

<h3>2. Readability: 20 points</h3>
  <h4>General Program Structure</h4>
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>20</td> <td>Correct comments at top of class, above each method, above each field (if any fields are present),
                      above each loop, and next to or above each variable.  (Comments are -not- required next to any index variables used in the loops.)  
		      The comments are at most one to three sentences and are a good
                      description.  The comments above each loop indicate how the loop works and any prerequisites for the 
                      loop.  (The loop subgoal/invariant would be nice but is -not- required.)
                     All code follows the proper indentation and
                     naming style.  An empty line is placed between the end of one method and the comment of the next.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td> <td>Mostly indented well (up to two places not indented correctly) AND most names correctly follow the
                      naming convention (up to two poorly named variables or methods) AND at most one missing comment on a loop or other complicated code.
                      Each comment is a good description.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>16</td> <td>Good indentation for at least three of the methods AND at least half of the methods and loops have comments that are at most
                      1-3 sentences and not direct copies of the homework description.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td> <td>At least one method is well commented or there is a comment above every method and the class AND at least one method is nicely indented.</td>
  <tr><td>6</td>  <td>At least one method is well commented OR at least one method is nicely indented.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0</td>  <td>No methods have either good comments or good indentation.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
 

<h3>3. Correctness: 60 points</h3>
  <h4>Each of the five methods will be graded as follows: 12 points </h4>
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>12</td> <td>The method gives the correct output.  The method is efficient and completes the task with an appropriate number of traversals of the data.
The method correctly uses <tt>StringBuilder</tt> and does not create unnecessary <tt>String</tt> instances.  
The method does not use <tt>break</tt> (or break-like loop constructs), <tt>continue</tt> or anything other than the allowed methods of <tt>String</tt>, <tt>StringBuilder</tt>, and <tt>Character</tt>.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>11</td>  <td>The method works correctly on all but at most two boundary cases (for example: the test 0,
test first, or test last cases), the method is efficient, and only uses allowed methods and operators. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>10</td>  <td>The method works correctly on most non-boundary cases OR the method works correctly but uses <tt>break</tt> (or break-like loop constructs) or <tt>continue</tt>, creates additional <tt>String objects</tt>, and/or
uses many more traversals of the data than required. </td></tr>
  <tr><td>8</td>  <td>The method works correctly on at least one non-boundary case (test many/test middle) OR
the method works correctly but uses methods or classes you were asked not to use.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td>  <td>The method works correctly on at least one case OR the method has a reasonable loop for the problem.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td>  <td>A loop that traverses the String is provided.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0</td>  <td>Fails all cases and no loop to traverse the String is provided. </td></tr>
