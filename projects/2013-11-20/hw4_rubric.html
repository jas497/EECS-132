<h2>Programming Project 4 Grading Rubric</h2>

<h3>1. JUnit Testing: 20 points</h3>
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>20</td>  <td> Correct JUnit tests for all methods (inherited, not overridden methods do not need to be re-tested).  Tests of conditionals cover the different execution paths.
			Tests of loops correctly test 0, 1, many and first, middle, last.
			Report clearly describes the kind of tests needed, and matches JUnit tests written.
			Descriptions of required tests for incomplete methods and descriptions of code errors are included.
		</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td>  <td> Similar to 20 except that a few obvious cases were not tested.
                        </td></tr>
  <tr><td>15</td>  <td> Correct JUnit tests for all methods, possibly missing just a few obvious cases, but no testing report provided OR  
                        a good testing report provided as well as mostly complete tests for at least three classes including the EmployeeDatabase class.
                        </td></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td>  <td> At least once class has all necessary JUnit tests completed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10</td>  <td> At least a few methods that have conditional statements or loops have correct JUnit tests written. </td><tr>
  <tr><td>0</td>   <td> No reasonable JUnit testing done.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
              
<h3>2. Readability: 20 points</h3>
  <h4> Basic program structure </h4>
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>10</td> <td>Correct comments at top of class, above each method, above each field (if any fields are present),
                      above each loop, and next to or above each variable.  (Comments are -not- required next to any index variables used in the loops.)
                      The comments are at most one to three sentences and are a good
                      description.  The comments above each loop indicate how the loop works and any prerequisites for the
                      loop.  (The loop subgoal/invariant would be nice but is -not- required.)
                     All code follows the proper indentation and
                     naming style.  An empty line is placed between the end of one method and the comment of the next.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>9</td> <td>Mostly indented well (up to two places not indented correctly) AND most names correctly follow the
                      naming convention (up to two poorly named variables or methods) AND at most one missing comment on a loop or other complicated code.
                      Each comment is a good description.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>8</td> <td>Good indentation for at least three of the methods AND at least half of the methods and loops have comments that are at most
                      1-3 sentences and not direct copies of the homework description.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td> <td>At least one method is well commented or there is a comment above every method and the class AND at least one method is nicely indented.</td>
  <tr><td>3</td>  <td>At least one method is well commented OR at least one method is nicely indented.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0</td>  <td>No methods have either good comments or good indentation.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

  <h4>JavaDoc Comments</h4>
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>10</td><td>All comments above the class, fields, and methods follow the JavaDoc comment style.  Correct tags are added
                     for the author, all method parameters and return types.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>9</td><td>All comments above the class, fields, and methods follow the JavaDoc comment style, and most of the comments
                    contain and have correct all required tags. (At most 5 missing or misspelled tags.)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>7</td><td>Most comments above the class, fields, and methods follow the JavaDoc comment style, but a significant number of places are
                     missing tags or the tags are misspelled so the comments are not formatted properly on the webpage.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>Most comments in JavaDoc style of /** but missing most tags OR has most tags but the comments do not start
                    with /** and so do not appear on the webpage.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0</td><td>No JavaDoc comments provided.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>3. Correctness: 60 points</h3>
  <h4>Performance correctness: 30 points</h4>
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>30</td> <td>All methods are done and correct.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>27</td> <td>Most of the methods are done and correct.  Only minor errors are found.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>24</td>  <td>Most of the methods are done and correct, but possibly significant errors in a few of the methods.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>21</td>  <td>At least half of the <tt>equals</tt>, <tt>toString</tt>, <tt>compare</tt>, and loop methods of the database work across all of the classes.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td>  <td>Many significant errors in the methods, but at least one of the <tt>equals</tt>, <tt>toString</tt>, <tt>compare</tt>, or loop methods of the database work across all the classes.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>9</td>  <td>The getter/setter methods of at least once class are correct.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0</td>  <td>Nothing works.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

  <h4>Good class hierarchy: 30 points</h4> 
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Metric</th></tr></thead>
  <tr><td>30</td><td>The class heirarchy is well organized and intuitive (every part of the hierarchy fits an "is-a" relation and all "is-a" relations in the project are included in the hierarchy), common methods
moved as high up the hierarchy as appropriate,
 and polymorphism is used to simplify the code everywhere that is appropriate.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>27</td><td>The class heirarchy is well organized and intuitive (every part of the hierarchy fits an "is-a" relation, and most "is-a" relations in the project are included in the hierarchy) AND/OR polymorphism is used to simplify the code most of the places that are appropriate AND/OR most methods are moved as high up the hierarchy as appropriate.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>24</td><td>The class heirarchy has all of the "is-a" relations of the project, but includes a few places where an extending class does not fit the "is-a" relation AND/OR polymorphism is used in many of
the places that are appropriate AND/OR many methods moved up the hierarchy but a significant number are unnecessarily duplicated between classes.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td><td>A hierarchy is created but some of the extended classes do not follow the "is-a" relation and some of the "is-a" relations of the project are not in the hierarchy AND/OR
polymorphism is used in some of the methods.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10</td><td>Some attempt at creating a hierarchy but no polymorphism is used.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0</td><td>No class hierarchy is created, no polymorphism is used.</td></tr>
  </tbody></table>

  <h4>Penalties:</h4>
  The following penalties will be applied
  <table border="2">
  <thead><tr><th>Points</th><th>Error</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>-3</td><td>The use of <tt>break</tt> or <tt>continue</tt> in loops (or any break-like loop organization).  <tt>break</tt> is allowed in a <tt>switch</tt> statement.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>-3</td><td>Unnecessarily long <tt>if</tt> statements.</td></tr>
