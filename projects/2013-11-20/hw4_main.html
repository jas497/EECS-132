<h2>Programming Project 4</h2>
<h3>Due Wednesday, November 20 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to create an object hierarchy.</p>

<p>To submit your project, click on the <em>Project 4</em> link, and you should find a <em>Submit</em> link.  Attach your
Java files and your testing report.
Remember to attach the file that end in <tt>.java</tt>, not <tt>.class</tt> or <tt>.java~</tt>.</p>

<h3>General Guidelines (20% of your grade will be based on using good style)</h3>

<p>Guidelines continued from past projects:
<ul>
<li>You should place a JavaDoc comment at the top of the file that contains your name (with an appropriate tag)
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> JavaDoc comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be one sentence and describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Be certain to use the
appropriate JavaDoc tags for parameters, return values, and exceptions (if appropriate). </li>
<li>You should place a short JavaDoc comment directly above any field indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a comment next to any local variable (loop indeces do not need comments) indicating the purpose
of the variable. </li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.
Ideally, you should list the goal of the
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good invariant for the loop.</li>
<li>The class should be organized so the fields are at the top, then the constructors, then the non-static methods,
and finally the static methods.  The <tt>main</tt> method should be last.</li>
<li>There should be an empty line between the end of one method and the start of the JavaDoc comment for the next method.</li>
<li>All variables and methods should be named according to the standard Java protocol.</li>
<li>All code should be indented appropriately.</li>
<li>You need to avoid unnecessary fields in your class. </li>
<li>Your loops should be simple.  Avoid nested loops unless they are required.</li>
</ul>
and some new guidelines for this homework:
<ul>
<li>You may add additional classes, interfaces, methods and fields to what is listed below.</li>
<li>You should not have an object store the same value in multiple fields. (For example, if the parent class has a field that
stores a value, the class that extends it should not have a field that stores the identical value.)</li>
<li>Your class hierarchy should be simple and intuitive.  Don't force a class to be a subclass of another if it does not make sense.</li>
<li>In a good hierarchy will significantly reduce the amount of code you need to write.</li>
</ul></p>


<h3>Programming (60% of the project grade)</h3>

<p>For this project you will implement a simple employee database.  Note that we did a small employee hierarchy as a lecture example.  You can use that as a guide,
but the specifications below are different and so you should not use exactly the lecture example.</p>

<p>Your project should contain the following classes:
<ol>
<li><p><em>SalariedEmployee:</em> a salaried employee is an employee that earns a fixed salary.  The necessary methods for <em>SalariedEmployee</em> are:
<ol>
<li><em>constructor:</em> <tt>(String firstName, String lastName, String number, double salary)</tt></li>

<li><tt>String getLastName()</tt>: returns the last name of the employee</li>
<li><tt>void setName(String firstName, String lastName)</tt>: sets the first and last names for the employee</li>

<li><tt>void setBonus(double bonus)</tt>: sets the bonus of the employee</li>
<li><tt>double getAmountEarned()</tt>: returns the total amount earned by the employee (equals the salary plus the bonus)</li>

<li><p><em>EmployeeDatabase:</em> a list of all the employees and supervisors of the company as well as helpful methods. 
The class should only have a generic constructor that creates an empty list.  The class should have the following features that
you will need to turn into one or more methods of the same, or slightly modified, names, as appropriate:
<ol>
<li><em>add</em>: the add method(s) lets you add an employee or a supervisor object to the database.  The object added should be the parameter to the method.</li>
<li><em>remove(first name, last name, number)</em> lets you remove an employee or a supervisor that matches the parameters first name, last name, and number.
The object removed from the database should be returned by the method.  A <tt>NoSuchEmployee</tt> exception should be thrown if no employee or supervisor matching the
given name and number is in the database.</em></li>
<li><em>find(first name, last name, number)</em> returns an employee or a supervisor object that matches the parameters first name, last name, and number.
Throws a <tt>NoSuchEmployee</tt> exception if no employee or supervisor matching the parameter values exists in the database.</li>
<li><em>getPayrollAmount</em>: returns the total amount that all employees and supervisors earned.</li>
<li><em>getMaximumEarned</em>: returns the employee or the supervisor who has the largest earnings in the database (break ties arbitrarily).  Returns <tt>null</tt>
if there are no emploees or supervisors in the database.</li>
<li><em>getMinimumEarned</em>: returns the employee or the supervisor who has the least earnings in the database (break ties arbitrarily).  Returns <tt>null</tt>
if there are no emploees or supervisors in the database.</li>
<li><em>getMaxSales</em>: returns the employee or the supervisor who has the largest number of sales (break ties arbitrarily). Throws a <tt>NoSuchEmployee</tt> exception
if there are no sales employees or sales supervisors in the database.</li>
<li><em>getMinSales</em>: returns the employee or the supervisor who has the least number of sales (break ties arbitrarily). Throws a <tt>NoSuchEmployee</tt> exception
if there are no sales employees or sales supervisors in the database.</li>
<li><em>getMaxHoursWorked</em>: returns the employee or the supervisor who worked the most hours (break ties arbitrarily). Throws a <tt>NoSuchEmployee</tt> exception
if there are no hourly employees or hourly supervisors in the database.</li>
<li><em>getMinHoursWorked</em>: returns the employee or the supervisor who worked the fewest hours (break ties arbitrarily). Throws a <tt>NoSuchEmployee</tt> exception
if there are no hourly employees or hourly supervisors in the database.</li>
<li><em>getSupervisees(supervisor)</em>: takes a supervisor object as input and returns an array that contains all the employee and supervisor objects
that the parameter supervisor supervises.  (The order of the objects in the array does not matter, but the length of the array should equal the total number
of supervisees.)</li>
</ol></p></li></ol>


<h3>JUnit Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>You are to write JUnit tests for your classes as well as a testing report.  The testing report should describe the <em>kinds</em> of tests that are required
for this project.  The JUnit testing classes should have comments and testing method names matching the specific tests to the descriptions in your report.</p>

<h3>Extra Credit:</h3>

<p>Write a <tt>main</tt> method for the <tt>EmployeeDatabase</tt> class.  The main method should create an empty database, and then the method should allow user input
(using the <tt>Scanner</tt> class) to manipulate the database, and the results should be output using <tt>System.out.print</tt>.  Here are some examples:
<pre>
> add salary John Lee 5 40000
Added 5: Lee, John, Salary Employee, with salary $40000.0 to the database
> add salarysupervisor Mary Cohen 4S 60000
Added 4S: Cohen, Mary, Salary Supervisor with salary $60000.0 to the database
> find John Lee 5
Retrieved 5: Lee, John, Salary Employee.
> set bonus 400.0
Set bonus for 5: Lee, John, Salary Employee to $400.0
> get bonus
Bonus for 5: Lee, John, Salary Employee is $400.0
> set supervisor Mary Cohen 4S
Set supervisor for 5: Lee, John, Salary Employee to 4S: Cohen, Mary, Salary Supervisor 
> find Mary Cohen 4S
Retrieved 4S: Cohen, Mary, Salary Supervisor.
> get supervisees
The list of supervisees for 4S: Cohen, Mary, Salary Supervisor is:
  5: Lee, John, Salary Employee
> find Thomas Smith 34
> No such employee
</pre>
